            <h2>Haley Benn</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Haley explored various dataset options, carefully assessing their compatibility with our codebase to determine the most suitable choice for the project. Additionally, Haley also researched the best Plotly/Dash visualizations to find the most effective visualization tools to present the data. Along with Amy, Haley worked on data analysis for the dataset so that when users click on the country a bar chart below automatically is generated showing the top 10 songs and artists for that country.

            <br>
            <p>Amy also researched the different datasets to use for the project to figure out which dataset would best fit our code. Amy also researched which plotly/dash visualization to use for the website to allow users to understand the data in an intuitive and easily understandable way. Amy also played a big role in helping preprocess the dataset in pandas to make our visualizations work.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Ryan developed the webapp using Python, Plotly, and Dash for interactive visuals. Ryan also worked with Amy to preprocess the dataset in pandas for data manipulation. Ryan also built the website's multipage framework in Dash. Ryan coded the interactive map visualization with a date filter bar, displaying top songs and artists for each country weekly.</p>
